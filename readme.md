The interTronic [X-AM] Cross-ActiveMemory Virtual Controller is a register-based, vintage style, virtual machine for Javascript in Node & browsers. It features:
- Support for low-level multitasking (max. 16 threads), with a CoreWars-inspired SPL instruction,
- Programmable through a custom assembly language, which is compiled to bytecode before execution,
- 64Kb of addressable memory,
- Each VM can be plugged to 6 other VMs to form a computing grid,
- Straightforward API allows easy implementation of HTML5/CSS3/JS devices,
- Designed to be like a MUD/MUSH where users and programs can share a subjective experience in "the Grid".
